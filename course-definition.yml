stages:
  - slug: "vi6"
    name: "Bind to a port"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement a TCP server that listens on port 9092.

      [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) is the underlying protocol used by protocols like HTTP, SSH and others
      you're probably familiar with. Kafka clients & brokers use TCP to communicate with each other.

      Don't worry if you're unfamiliar with the TCP protocol, or what Kafka clients & brokers are. You'll learn more about this in the
      next stages.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then try to connect to your TCP server on port 9092. If the connection succeeds, you'll pass this stage.

      ### Notes

      - 9092 is the default port that Kafka uses.
      - If you already have a Kafka broker running on your machine and listening on port 9092, you'll see a "port already in use" error when running your code. Try stopping the existing Kafka broker and running your code again.

    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll start a TCP server on port 9092, which is the
      default port that Redis uses.

  - slug: "nv3"
    name: "Send Correlation ID"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll respond to a request with a hardcoded correlation ID.

      ### Kafka wire protocol

      The [Kafka wire protocol](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html) is a binary protocol used by Kafka brokers and clients to communicate with each other.

      All communication over this protocol happens in request-response pairs. A client sends a request to the broker, and the broker responds with a response.

      You'll implement support for this protocol over the next few stages. We'll break down the protocol into smaller pieces and implement them one by one.

      ### Kafka requests

      Examples of some commonly used Kafka requests:

      - `APIVersions`, used to get the supported API versions by the broker
      - `Fetch`, used to get data from the broker
      - `Produce`, used to send data to the broker

      We'll learn about these in detail later, for now we'll focus on the protocol format itself.

      ### Request/Response format

      As described in [the docs](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html#protocol_common), each request and response in the Kafka wire protocol starts with 4 bytes that
      describe the length of the entire message (this includes the header & body), followed by the message. This is true for both requests and responses.

      The first 4 bytes are encoded as an int32 (4 bytes, big-endian / network byte order).

      For example, if the length of the message is 10, the first 4 bytes (in hexadecimal) will be `00 00 00 0a` (`0a` is the hexadecimal representation of 10).

      ### Response header format

      Each response to a Kafka request contains a header and a body. The header format is the same for all responses (irrespective of request type), but the body format varies by request type.

      The response header format is as follows:

      - `correlation_id`: An integer that uniquely identifies the request (the client sends this value in the request)
        - This is an "INT32" according to the Kafka wire protocol
        - It is a signed integer, encoded using 4 bytes in the response (big-endian / network byte order)
      - `tag_buffer`: An array of optional "tagged fields"
        - This can be ignored for now, they're [optional tagged fields](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-482%3A+The+Kafka+Protocol+should+Support+Optional+Tagged+Fields) used to introduce additional features over time.

      As mentioned in the previous section, the header is preceded by 4 bytes that describe the length of the entire message (header and body combined).

      ### Response body format

      The response body format varies by request type. We'll cover this in later stages.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send a `APIVersions` request. You don't need to implement the logic to parse this request yet.

      The tester will wait to receive a response from your server. It will expect at least 8 bytes of data (4 bytes for the message length + 4 bytes for the correlation ID).

      The tester won't validate the first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") in this stage. The tester will assert that the next 4 bytes are `00 00 00 07` (7, encoded
      as a 4 byte integer in big-endian).

      ### Notes

      - In this stage you're expected to hardcode the correlation ID as `7` in your response. We'll get to reading this value from the request in later stages.
      - Since the response format is currently incomplete, the first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") will not be validated in this stage. We'll get to this in later stages.
      - You don't need to parse the request in this stage. We'll get to this in later stages.

    name: "Parse Correlation ID"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll parse the correlation ID from a request and send a response with the same correlation ID.

      ### Request header format

      In the previous stage, we saw that the request starts with a 4 byte length field, followed by the request header, and then the request body.

      The format of the request header is as follows:

      | Field Name            | Field Type      | Description                               |
      |-----------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
      | `request_api_key`     | INT16           | The API key for the request               |
      | `request_api_version` | INT16           | The version of the API for the request    |
      | `correlation_id`      | INT32           | A unique identifier for the request       |
      | `client_id`           | NULLABLE_STRING | The client ID for the request             |
      | `tagged_fields`       | TAGGED_FIELDS   | Optional tagged fields                    |

      The documentation for this can be found [here](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html#protocol_messages) under the "Request Header v3" section.

      - `request_api_key`: An integer identifying the type of request.
        - The value of this field is different for each type of request.
        - For example, the `APIVersions` request has a `request_api_key` of `18`.
        - A full list of API keys can be found in [the docs](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html#protocol_api_keys).
      - `request_api_version`: The version of the API for the request.
        - This is an integer that identifies the version of the API for the request.
        - For example, the `APIVersions` request supports multiple versions: `0`, `1`, `2` and `3`.
      - `correlation_id`: A unique identifier for the request.
        - This value is echo-ed back in the response.
        - (This is the value you hardcoded in the previous stage!)
      - `client_id`: A string identifying the client that sent the request.
      - `tagged_fields`: Optional tagged fields
        - This can be ignored for now, they're [optional tagged fields](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-482%3A+The+Kafka+Protocol+should+Support+Optional+Tagged+Fields) used to introduce additional features over time.

      In this stage, you'll only need to parse the `correlation_id` field. You can ignore the other fields for now.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send a `APIVersions` request. The tester will include a random
      correlation ID in this request.

      The tester will wait for your program to respond and it'll then validate that the correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID it send in the request header.

      Just like the previous stage, the tester won't validate the first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") in this stage.

      ### Notes

      - You can remove the hardcoded correlation ID of `7` we used in the previous stage. You can now read this value from the request.
      - Since the response format is currently incomplete, the first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") will not be validated in this stage. We'll get to this in later stages.
      - You don't need to parse all fields in the request in this stage, just the `correlation_id` field. We'll get to the other fields in later stages.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send a `APIVersions` request. This request will include an invalid `APIVersion` (Example: `-1`).

      Any version other than `0`, `1`, `2` and `3` should be considered an invalid version.

      Your server should respond with an error code of `35` (UNSUPPORTED_VERSION).

      The tester will validate that:

      - The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
      - The error code in the response body is `35` (UNSUPPORTED_VERSION).

      The tester won't validate the first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") in this stage. We'll get to this in later stages.

      It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send a valid `APIVersions` (v3) request.

      The tester will validate that:

      - The first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") are valid.
      - The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
      - The error code in the response body is `0` (No Error).
      - The response body contains at least one entry for the API key `18` (API_VERSIONS).
      - The `MaxVersion` for the `ApiKey` `18` is atleast `3`.

      ### Notes

      - The tester will always send you v3 of the APIVersions request.
      - From this stage onwards, the tester will start validating the first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") in addition to the other checks.
      - If extra bytes are remaining after decoding all the fields of the response body, this will be considered an error.

      It will then send a valid `APIVersions` (v3) request, read the response, & validate the response. 
      It will repeat this process 2-3 times.

      The validations that the tester will perform are:

      - The first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") are valid.
      - The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
      - The error code in the response body is `0` (No Error).

      It'll instantiate 2-3 clients, and open connections to your server on port 9092 from all of them. (It will be sequential, so the first client will connect before the second one, and so on.)
      From each connection, it'll send a valid `APIVersions` (v3) request.
      It will read the responses from all the connections and validate them.

      Each operation will be performed by all clients before the next operation begins.
      So, all clients connect first.
      Then, all clients send `APIVersions` (v3) request concurrently.
      Then, all clients read the responses concurrently, and validate them.

      It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send a `Fetch:V16` request. The tester will validate that the correlation ID in the response header matches
      the correlation ID in the request header. The tester will also validate that the error code in the response body is 0.
      Then, it will validate that the response body contains a topicResponse for the topic provided in the request.
      And that the topicResponse contains a partitionResponse for the partition provided in the request.

      The partitionResponse should contain a messageSet with a RecordBatch.
      Which should in turn contain a Record which should contain a string with the hardcoded message.

      You need to send 3 such messages in the response.
      The messages should be `m1, m2, m3`.

      The RecordBatch has a CRC field, which is computed using the Castagnoli polynomial. This CRC field in the response should match with the CRC computed from the RecordBatch contents.

      ### Notes
      - We will send an `Fetch` request with an `APIVersion` of 16.

    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the Fetch response for a topic with multiple messages.

  - slug: "eg2"
    primary_extension_slug: "consuming-messages"
    name: "Fetch single message from disk"
    difficulty: hard
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement the Fetch response for a given topic and partition with a single message.
      But, the messages are written to disk, and you'll have to read them from there.

      🚧 **We're still working on this stage**.
