    name: "Bind to a port"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll implement a TCP server that listens on port 9092.

      [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol) is the underlying protocol that Kafka brokers and clients use to communicate with each other.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then try to connect to your TCP server on port 9092. If the connection succeeds, you'll pass this stage.

      ### Notes

      - If you already have a Kafka broker running on port 9092 and you run your program, you'll get a "port already in use" error. To fix this, terminate the existing Kafka broker and run your program again.
      - 9092 is the default port that Kafka uses.
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll start a TCP server on port 9092, which is the
      default port that Kafka uses.

    name: "Send Correlation ID"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll send a response with a correlation ID.

      ### Response message

      Kafka brokers communicate with clients through the [Kafka wire protocol](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html). The protocol uses a request-response model, where the client sends a request message and the broker replies with a response message.

      A Kafka response message has three parts:
      1. `message_size`
      2. Header
      3. Body

      For this stage, you can ignore the body and just focus on `message_size` and the header. You'll learn about response bodies in a later stage.

      #### The `message_size` field

      The [`message_size`](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html#protocol_common) field is a 32-bit signed integer. It specifies the size of the header and body.

      For this stage, the tester will only assert that your `message_size` field is 4 bytes long—it won't check the value. You'll implement correct `message_size` values in a later stage.

      #### Header

      Kafka has a few different header versions. The way Kafka determines which header version to use is a bit complicated and is outside the scope of this challenge. For more information, take a look at [KIP-482](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/KAFKA/KIP-482%3A+The+Kafka+Protocol+should+Support+Optional+Tagged+Fields) and this [Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71853003).

      In this stage, you will use [response header v0](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html#protocol_messages) (scroll down).

      Response header v0 contains a single field: [`correlation_id`](https://developer.confluent.io/patterns/event/correlation-identifier/). This field lets clients match responses to their original requests. Here's how it works:

      1. The client generates a correlation ID.
      2. The client sends a request that includes the correlation ID.
      3. The broker sends a response that includes the same correlation ID.
      4. The client receives the response and matches the correlation ID to the original request.

      The `correlation_id` field is a 32-bit signed integer. For this stage, your program must respond with a hard-coded `correlation_id` of 7.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then connect to your broker on port 9092 and send a request:
      ```
      $ echo -n "Placeholder request" | nc -v localhost 9092 | hexdump -C
      ```

      Your broker must send a response with a correlation ID of 7:
      ```java
      00 00 00 00  // message_size:   0 (any value works)
      00 00 00 07  // correlation_id: 7
      ```

      ### Notes

      - For this stage, you don't need to parse the request. You'll learn about request parsing in a later stage.
      - All integers are in [big-endian](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Endianness) order.

      In this stage, you'll replace the hard-coded correlation ID with the actual correlation ID from the request.

      ### Request message

      A request message has three parts:
      1. `message_size`
      2. Header
      3. Body

      To get the `correlation_id` field, you need to find its offset. You already know that `message_size` is 4 bytes long. And here's what the request header looks like (in this stage, we're using [request header v2](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html#protocol_messages)):

      | Field                 | Data type         | Description                            |
      | --------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
      | `request_api_key`     | `INT16`           | The API key for the request            |
      | `request_api_version` | `INT16`           | The version of the API for the request |
      | `correlation_id`      | `INT32`           | A unique identifier for the request    |
      | `client_id`           | `NULLABLE_STRING` | The client ID for the request          |
      | `TAG_BUFFER`          | `COMPACT_ARRAY`   | Optional tagged fields                 |

      To learn more about the different data types, see [Protocol Primitive Types](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html#protocol_types).

      #### Example

      Here's an example of a request message:
      ```java
      00 00 00 23  // message_size:        35
      00 12        // request_api_key:     18
      00 04        // request_api_version: 4
      6f 7f c6 61  // correlation_id:      1870644833
      ...
      ```

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```
      $ ./your_program.sh
      ```

      It'll then connect to your broker on port 9092 and send a request with a request header v2:
      ```
      $ echo -n "00000023001200046f7fc66100096b61666b612d636c69000a6b61666b612d636c6904302e3100" | xxd -r -p | nc localhost 9092 | hexdump -C
      ```

      Your broker must send a response with the correct correlation ID:
      ```java
      00 00 00 00  // message_size:   0 (any value works)
      6f 7f c6 61  // correlation_id: 1870644833
      ```

      ### Notes

      - For this stage, you don't need to worry about what the request is asking for. You'll handle that in the next stage.
      - For this stage, the tester will only assert that your `message_size` field is 4 bytes long—it won't check the value. You'll implement correct `message_size` values in a later stage.
      - The request header version and response header version are unrelated to each other and do not have to match.

      ### Kafka APIs

      Every Kafka request is an API call. The Kafka protocol defines over 70 different APIs, all of which do different things. Here are some examples:
      - `Produce` writes events to partitions.
      - `CreateTopics` creates new topics.
      - `ApiVersions` returns the broker's supported API versions.

      A Kafka request specifies the API its calling by using the [`request_api_key`](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html#protocol_api_keys) header field.

      ### Message body

      The schemas for the request and response bodies are determined by the API being called.

      For example, here are some of the fields that the [`Produce`](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html#The_Messages_Produce) request body contains:

      - The name of the topic to write to.
      - The key of the partition to write to.
      - The event data to write.

      On the other hand, the `Produce` response body contains a response code for each event. These response codes indicate if the writes succeeded.

      As a reminder, requests and responses both have the following format:

      1. `message_size`
      2. Header
      3. Body

      ### API versioning

      Each API supports multiple versions, to allow for different schemas. Here's how API versioning works:
      - Requests use the header field `request_api_version` to specify the API version being requested.
      - Responses always use the same API version as the request. For example, a `Produce Request (Version: 3)` will always get a `Produce Response (Version: 3)` back.
      - Each API's version history is independent. So, different APIs with the same version are unrelated. For example, `Produce Request (Version: 10)` is not related to `Fetch Request (Version: 10)`.

      ### The `ApiVersions` API

      The [`ApiVersions`](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html#The_Messages_ApiVersions) API returns the broker's supported API versions. For example, `ApiVersions` may say that the broker supports `Produce` versions 5 to 11, `Fetch` versions 0 to 3, etc.

      In this stage, you'll begin to add support for `ApiVersions` version 4. For this stage, you only need to add support for the `error_code` field. You'll implement the other fields in later stages.

      Note: As of Oct 30th 2024, [version 4](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/84caaa6e9da06435411510a81fa321d4f99c351f/clients/src/main/resources/common/message/ApiVersionsRequest.json#L25C22-L25C33) of `ApiVersions` is still unreleased, so it isn't available in the Kafka docs yet. However, the request and response formats for `ApiVersions` version 4 are identical to those of version 3. The docs for version 4 will be available once Kafka 3.9 is released.

      The `ApiVersions` response body begins with `error_code`, a 16-bit signed integer. This field indicates if an error occurred with the request. It's set to 0 if there was no error. To see all the possible values, consult the [error codes chart](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html#protocol_error_codes).

      You only need to add support for error code 35, `UNSUPPORTED_VERSION`. This error code occurs when the version of `ApiVersions` requested by the client is not supported by the broker. Assume that your broker only supports versions 0 to 4.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:
      ```
      $ ./your_program.sh  
      ```

      It'll then connect to your broker on port 9092 and send an `ApiVersions` request. This request will ask for an unsupported version of `ApiVersions`:
      ```
      $ echo -n "000000230012674a4f74d28b00096b61666b612d636c69000a6b61666b612d636c6904302e3100" | xxd -r -p | nc localhost 9092 | hexdump -C
      ```
      ```java
      00 00 00 23  // message_size:        35
      00 12        // request_api_key:     18
      67 4a        // request_api_version: 26442
      4f 74 d2 8b  // correlation_id:      1333056139
      ...
      ```

      Your broker must send an `ApiVersions` version 4 response with the `error_code` field set to 35:
      ```java
      00 00 00 00  // message_size:   0 (any value works)
      4f 74 d2 8b  // correlation_id: 1333056139
      00 23        // error_code:     35
      ```

      ### Notes

      - The Kafka protocol's APIs are different from Kafka's [core APIs](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#intro_apis). The core APIs are higher-level Java and Scala APIs that wrap around the Kafka protocol.
      - You can assume that the tester will only send you an `ApiVersions` request. You don't need to check the `request_api_key` field in the header.
      - For this stage, the tester will only assert that your `message_size` field is 4 bytes long—it won't check the value. You'll implement correct `message_size` values in a later stage.

      to ask questions on the forum.

      ### Tests

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```

      It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send a valid `APIVersions` (v4) request.

      The tester will validate that:

      - The first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") are valid.
      - The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
      - The error code in the response body is `0` (No Error).
      - The response body contains at least one entry for the API key `18` (API_VERSIONS).
      - The `MaxVersion` for the `ApiKey` `18` is at least `4`.

      ### Notes

      - The tester will always send you v4 of the APIVersions request.
        - As of Oct 30th 2024, v4 is "unreleased" so isn't available in the Kafka docs yet. It'll
          be available once Kafka 3.9 is released. Here's a link to the [Kafka source code](https://github.com/apache/kafka/blob/84caaa6e9da06435411510a81fa321d4f99c351f/clients/src/main/resources/common/message/ApiVersionsRequest.json#L25C22-L25C33) mentioning this.
        - The structure for v4 is the same as v3 listed in the docs.
      - From this stage onwards, the tester will start validating the first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") in addition to the other checks.
      - If extra bytes are remaining after decoding all the fields of the response body, this will be considered an error.

      The tester will execute your program like this:

      ```bash
      $ ./your_program.sh /tmp/server.properties
      ```

      It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send a `DescribeTopicPartitions` (v0) request. The request will contain a single topic with 1 partition.

      The tester will validate that:

      - The first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") are valid.
      - The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
      - The error code in the response body is 3 (`UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION`).
      - The response body should be valid DescribeTopicPartitions (v0) Response.
      - The `topic_name` field in the response should be equal to the topic name sent in the request.
      - The `topic_id` field in the response should be equal to `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.
      - The `partitions` field in the response should be empty. (As there are no partitions assigned to this non-existent topic.)

      ### Notes

      - You'll need to parse the `DescribeTopicPartitions` request in this stage to get the topic name to send in the response.
      - For now, you can assume that all topics are "unknown". We'll work on identifying actual vs. unknown topics in later stages.

      In this stage, you'll implement the `DescribeTopicPartitions` response for a single topic.

      Kafka stores metadata about topics in the `__cluster_metadata` topic. To check if a topic exists or not, you'll need to read
      the `__cluster_metadata` topic's log file, located at `/tmp/kraft-combined-logs/__cluster_metadata-0/00000000000000000000.log`.

      We've created an interactive protocol inspector for the cluster metadata log file and the `DescribeTopicPartitions` response:

      - 🔎 [Cluster Metadata Log File](https://binspec.org/kafka-cluster-metadata)
      - 🔎 [DescribeTopicPartitions Response (v0)](https://binspec.org/kafka-describe-topic-partitions-response-v0)
