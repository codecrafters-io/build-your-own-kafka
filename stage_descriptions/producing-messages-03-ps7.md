In this stage, you'll add support for successfully producing a single record.

## Single Record Production

When a Kafka broker receives a Produce request, it needs to validate that the topic and partition exist (using the `__cluster_metadata` topic's log file), store the record in the appropriate log file using Kafka's on-disk format, and return a successful response with the assigned offset.

The record must be persisted to the topic's log file at `<log-dir>/<topic-name>-<partition-index>/00000000000000000000.log` using Kafka's RecordBatch format.

We've created an interactive protocol inspector for the request & response structures for `Produce`:

- ðŸ”Ž [Produce Request (v11)](https://binspec.org/kafka-produce-request-v11)
- ðŸ”Ž [Produce Response (v11)](https://binspec.org/kafka-produce-response-v11)

Kafka's on-disk log format uses the same [RecordBatch](add-link) format that is used in `Produce` and `Fetch` requests.

You can refer to the following interactive protocol inspector for Kafka's log file format:
- ðŸ”Ž [__cluster_metadata topic's log file](https://binspec.org/kafka-cluster-metadata)

## Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
./your_program.sh /tmp/server.properties
```

It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send multiple successive `Produce` (v11) requests with single records.

The tester will validate that:

- The first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") are valid.
- The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
- The error code in the response body is `0` (NO_ERROR).
- The `throttle_time_ms` field in the response is `0`.
- Inside the topic response:
  - The `name` field matches the topic name in the request.
  - Inside the partition response:
    - The `index` field matches the partition in the request.
    - The `base_offset` field contains the assigned offset for the record. (The `base_offset` is the offset of the record in the partition, not the offset of the batch. So 0 for the first record, 1 for the second record, and so on.)
    - The `log_append_time_ms` field is `-1` (signifying that the timestamp is the latest).
    - The `log_start_offset` field is `0`.
- The record is persisted to the appropriate log file on disk at `<log-dir>/<topic-name>-<partition-index>/00000000000000000000.log`.

## Notes

- On-disk log files must be stored in `RecordBatch` format with proper CRC validation.
- The offset assignment should start from `0` for new partitions and increment for each subsequent record.
- The official docs for the `Produce` request can be found [here](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html#The_Messages_Produce). Make sure to scroll down to the "Produce Response (Version: 11)" section.
