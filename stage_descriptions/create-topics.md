Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can see how the produce extension was broken down
  into logical stages and provide recommendations for structuring the create-topics extension
  similarly.

  How Produce Extension Stages Were Organized

  The produce extension follows this logical progression:

  P1-P2: Foundation & Discovery
  - P1: Include Produce in APIVersions response
  - P2: Handle unknown topics (error handling)

  P3-P4: Basic Validation & Core Functionality
  - P3: Handle invalid partitions (error handling)
  - P4: Single record produce (basic success case)

  P5-P7: Increasing Complexity
  - P5: Multiple messages in single batch
  - P6: Multiple partitions of same topic
  - P7: Multiple topics in single request

  Recommended Create-Topics Extension Structure

  Following the same pattern, here's how create-topics could be broken down:

  Stage CT1: Include CreateTopics in APIVersions

  - Add API key 19 (CreateTopics) to APIVersions response
  - Foundation stage enabling API discovery

  Stage CT2: CreateTopics with Invalid Topic Name

  - Handle invalid characters, reserved names, empty names
  - Error code: INVALID_TOPIC_EXCEPTION (17)

  Stage CT3: CreateTopics with Reserved Topic Name

  - Handle attempts to create system topics (__cluster_metadata)
  - Error code: INVALID_REQUEST (42)

  Stage CT4: CreateTopics with Existing Topic Name

  - Handle duplicate topic creation attempts
  - Error code: TOPIC_ALREADY_EXISTS (36)

  Stage CT5: CreateTopics with Invalid Parameters

  - Handle negative/zero partitions, invalid replication factors
  - Error codes: INVALID_PARTITIONS (37), INVALID_REPLICATION_FACTOR (38)

  Stage CT6: CreateTopics with Valid Parameters (Success Case)

  - Successfully create single topic with valid parameters
  - Core success functionality

  Optional Advanced Stages:

  - CT7: Multiple topics in single request
  - CT8: Topic-specific configurations
  - CT9: Validation-only mode

  Key Differences from Produce Extension

  1. Administrative vs Operational: CreateTopics affects cluster metadata permanently
  2. Complex Validation: Topic names, parameters, system restrictions
  3. Different Error Codes: Specific to topic creation scenarios
  4. Metadata Persistence: Updates cluster metadata, not message logs

  This structure provides a logical progression from API discovery through comprehensive error
   handling to successful topic creation, following the established patterns while addressing
  the unique requirements of the CreateTopics API.
