In this stage, you'll add an entry for the `Produce` API to the APIVersions response.

## APIVersions

Your Kafka implementation should include the Produce API (key=0) in the ApiVersions response before implementing produce functionality. This would let the client know that the broker supports the Produce API.

## Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
./your_program.sh /tmp/server.properties
```

It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send a valid `APIVersions` (v4) request.

The tester will validate that:

- The first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") are valid.
- The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
- The error code in the response body is `0` (No Error).
- The response body contains at least one entry for the API key `0` (Produce).
- The `MaxVersion` for the Produce API is at least 11.

## Notes

- You don't have to implement support for the `Produce` request in this stage. We'll get to this in later stages.
- You'll still need to include the entry for `APIVersions` in your response to pass the previous stage.
