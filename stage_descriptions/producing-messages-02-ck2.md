In this stage, you'll add support for handling Produce requests to invalid topics or partitions.

## Produce API Response for Invalid Topics or Partitions

When a Kafka broker receives a Produce request, it needs to validate that both the topic and partition exist. If either the topic or partition doesn't exist, it returns an appropriate error code and response.

The broker performs validation in this order:
1. **Topic validation**: Check if the topic exists by reading the `__cluster_metadata` topic's log file
2. **Partition validation**: If the topic exists, check if the partition exists within that topic

### Topic Validation

To validate that a topic exists, the broker reads the `__cluster_metadata` topic's log file, located at `/tmp/kraft-combined-logs/__cluster_metadata-0/00000000000000000000.log`. Inside the log file, the broker finds the topic's metadata, which is a `record` (inside a RecordBatch) with a payload of type `TOPIC_RECORD`. If there exists a `TOPIC_RECORD` with the given topic name and the topic ID, the topic exists.

### Partition Validation

To validate that a partition exists, the broker reads the same `__cluster_metadata` topic's log file and finds the partition's metadata, which is a `record` (inside a RecordBatch) with a payload of type `PARTITION_RECORD`. If there exists a `PARTITION_RECORD` with the given partition index, the UUID of the topic it is associated with, and the UUID of the directory it is associated with, the partition exists.

If either the topic or partition doesn't exist, the broker returns an error code of `3` (UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION).

We've created an interactive protocol inspector for the request & response structures for `Produce`:

- ðŸ”Ž [Produce Request (v11)](https://binspec.org/kafka-produce-request-v11)
- ðŸ”Ž [Produce Response (v11)](https://binspec.org/kafka-produce-response-v11)

We've also created an interactive protocol inspector for the `__cluster_metadata` topic's log file:
- ðŸ”Ž [__cluster_metadata log file](https://binspec.org/kafka-cluster-metadata)

In this stage, you'll need to implement the response for a `Produce` request with either an invalid topic or invalid partition. In later stages, you'll handle successfully producing messages to valid topics and partitions, persist messages to disk using Kafka's RecordBatch format, manage offset assignment, handle batch processing, and support multiple partitions and topics.

## Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
./your_program.sh /tmp/server.properties
```

It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send a `Produce` (v11) request with either an invalid topic name or a valid topic but invalid partition.

The tester will validate that:

- The first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") are valid.
- The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
- The `error_code` in the response body is `3` (UNKNOWN_TOPIC_OR_PARTITION).
- The `throttle_time_ms` field in the response is `0`.
- The topic response contains:
  - The `name` field corresponds to the topic name in the request.
  - The partition response contains:
    - The `index` field corresponds to the partition in the request.
    - The `base_offset` field is `-1`.
    - The `log_append_time_ms` field is `-1`.
    - The `log_start_offset` field is `-1`.

## Notes

- You'll need to parse the `Produce` request in this stage to get the topic name and partition to send in the response.
- The official docs for the `Produce` request can be found [here](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html#The_Messages_Produce). Make sure to scroll down to the "Produce Response (Version: 11)" section.
- The official Kafka docs don't cover the structure of records inside the `__cluster_metadata` topic, but you can find the definitions in the Kafka source code [here](https://github.com/apache/kafka/tree/5b3027dfcbcb62d169d4b4421260226e620459af/metadata/src/main/resources/common/metadata).
