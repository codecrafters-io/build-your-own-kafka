> How does the CreateTopic API work ?

⏺ I'll help you understand how the CreateTopic API works in Kafka. Let me search through the codebase to find
  the relevant implementation.

⏺ Task(Search CreateTopic API implementation)
  ⎿  Done (37 tool uses · 50.2k tokens · 5m 20.9s)                                                              

⏺ The CreateTopic API in Kafka follows a controller-based architecture with these key components:

  Core Flow:
  1. Client sends CreateTopicsRequest to the controller broker
  2. Controller validates permissions, configurations, and partition assignments
  3. Controller writes metadata records to the Raft log
  4. Metadata propagates to all brokers
  5. Response returns success/failure for each topic

  Key Files:
  - clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/clients/admin/Admin.java - Client interface
  - clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/requests/CreateTopicsRequest.java - Request class
  - core/src/main/scala/kafka/server/ControllerApis.scala - Request handler
  - metadata/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/controller/ReplicationControlManager.java - Core logic

  Validation Steps:
  - Topic name validation and conflict checking
  - Partition count and replication factor validation
  - Authorization (CREATE permissions)
  - Configuration policy enforcement
  - Quota and rate limiting

  Partition Assignment:
  - Manual: Use provided replica assignments
  - Automatic: ReplicaPlacer distributes across available brokers
  - Validates ISR availability

  The API supports both synchronous validation (validateOnly=true) and asynchronous creation with configurable
  timeouts.

> What are some error cases of the API, that I can implement early before touching the core logic ?

⏺ Task(Find CreateTopic API error cases)
  ⎿  Done (38 tool uses · 52.6k tokens · 4m 40.6s)                                                              

⏺ Here are the early validation error cases you can implement before touching core logic:

  Input Validation Errors (Immediate Validation)

  1. Topic Name Validation - INVALID_TOPIC_EXCEPTION (17)
  - Empty topic name or "." or ".."
  - Length > 249 characters
  - Invalid characters (only ASCII alphanumerics, '.', '_', '-')
  - Internal topic collision detection

  2. Partition Count Validation - INVALID_PARTITIONS (37)
  - Negative or zero partition count
  - Message: "Number of partitions was set to an invalid non-positive value."

  3. Replication Factor Validation - INVALID_REPLICATION_FACTOR (38)
  - Negative or zero replication factor
  - Message: "Replication factor must be larger than 0, or -1 to use the default value."

  4. Request Format Validation - INVALID_REQUEST (42)
  - Duplicate topic names in single request
  - Version compatibility issues (validateOnly in v0, defaults in v<4)

  5. Manual Assignment Validation - INVALID_REPLICA_ASSIGNMENT (39)
  - Assignment with non-(-1) replication factor/partition count
  - Non-consecutive partition indices
  - Empty replica lists
  - Duplicate broker IDs in assignment

  6. Configuration Validation - INVALID_CONFIG (40)
  - Null config values
  - Message: "Null value not supported for topic configs"

  7. Authorization Check - TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (29)
  - No CREATE permission on CLUSTER or TOPIC resource

  8. Existing Topic Check - TOPIC_ALREADY_EXISTS (36)
  - Topic name already exists

  9. Internal Topic Protection - INVALID_REQUEST (42)
  - Attempting to create __cluster_metadata topic

  These validations happen in ControllerApis.scala:396-442 and ReplicationControlManager.java:635-765 before any
   core topic creation logic, making them perfect for early error detection.

> Yep these are just validations tho. As part of the core logic. I was talking more about when we send a PRODUCE
   request with an non-existent topic it just returns an error. So we have to parse the request, encode the 
  response but no core logic. Something similar here ?

⏺ Ah, I understand now! You're looking for request parsing and response encoding error cases that happen at the
  protocol level, before any business logic. Let me search for those.

⏺ Task(Find protocol-level CreateTopic errors)
  ⎿  Done (33 tool uses · 69.6k tokens · 2m 57.4s)                                                              

⏺ Perfect! Now I understand what you're looking for. Here are the protocol-level error cases for CreateTopic
  that you can implement with just request parsing and response encoding:

  Protocol-Level Error Cases (No Core Logic)

  1. Request Deserialization Errors - INVALID_REQUEST (42)
  - Malformed request buffer (corrupted array lengths, invalid byte arrays)
  - Buffer underflow/overflow during parsing
  - Invalid field types or corrupted data

  2. Version Mismatch Errors - UNSUPPORTED_VERSION (35)
  - Using validateOnly with version 0
  - Using default partitions/replication factor with version < 4
  - Requesting unsupported API version

  3. Message Size Limit - MESSAGE_TOO_LARGE (10)
  - Request exceeds broker's message.max.bytes limit
  - Happens during request parsing before any business logic

  4. Required Field Validation - INVALID_REQUEST (42)
  - Missing topic name in request
  - Invalid request structure per protocol schema

  5. Array Size Validation - INVALID_REQUEST (42)
  - Malformed array lengths that would cause allocation errors
  - Prevents oversized collection allocation

  The key files for implementing these:
  - clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/requests/CreateTopicsRequest.java:96-109 - getErrorResponse()
  method
  - clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/requests/RequestContext.java:119-129 - request parsing
  - clients/src/main/resources/common/message/CreateTopicsRequest.json - protocol schema

  These errors are caught during request deserialization and can return proper CreateTopicsResponse with
  per-topic error codes, just like how PRODUCE returns errors for non-existent topics - no business logic
  required!

> Nope. See this doc. /Users/ryang/Developer/work/course-testers/kafka-tester/Kafka-breakdown.md\
  I need something similar for the CreateTopic API.

⏺ Read(../../../work/course-testers/kafka-tester/Kafka-breakdown.md)
  ⎿  Read 327 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now I understand what you're looking for. You want early error cases for the CreateTopic API that can
   be implemented with just request parsing and response encoding, similar to how the Produce API handles
  non-existent topics.

  Here's what I would suggest for CreateTopic API stages:

  CreateTopic API Early Error Cases

  Stage 1: Include CreateTopic in APIVersions
  - Add CreateTopic API (key=19) to APIVersions response
  - MaxVersion should be at least 7
  - No actual CreateTopic logic needed

  Stage 2: CreateTopic with Invalid Topic Name
  - Parse CreateTopic request to extract topic name
  - Check for invalid topic names (empty, ".", "..", invalid chars)
  - Return INVALID_TOPIC_EXCEPTION (17) error response
  - No core topic creation logic needed

  Stage 3: CreateTopic with Invalid Partition/Replication Values
  - Parse partition count and replication factor from request
  - Return INVALID_PARTITIONS (37) for partition count ≤ 0
  - Return INVALID_REPLICATION_FACTOR (38) for replication factor ≤ 0
  - Just request parsing + response encoding

  Stage 4: CreateTopic with Existing Topic
  - Check if topic directory already exists in log directory
  - Return TOPIC_ALREADY_EXISTS (36) if found
  - Simple filesystem check, no metadata parsing needed

  Stage 5: CreateTopic with Authorization Check
  - Return TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (29) based on simple config
  - No real authorization logic, just return the error code
  - Test the response structure

  These stages would let you implement and test:
  - Request parsing for CreateTopic
  - Response encoding with proper error codes
  - Per-topic error handling in responses
  - Basic filesystem checks

  Just like the Produce API stages, these focus on protocol handling and basic validation before any complex
  topic creation logic.

     ☐ Write detailed stage descriptions with test cases

⏺ Kafka / CreateTopics API

  Stage 1: Include CreateTopics in APIVersions

  In this stage, you'll add an entry for the CreateTopics API to the APIVersions response.

  APIVersions

  Your Kafka implementation should include the CreateTopics API (key=19) in the ApiVersions response before
  implementing topic creation functionality. This lets the client know that the broker supports the CreateTopics
   API.

  Tests

  The tester will execute your program like this:

  ./your_program.sh

  It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send a valid APIVersions (v4) request.

  The tester will validate that:

  - The first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") are valid.
  - The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
  - The error code in the response body is 0 (No Error).
  - The response body contains at least one entry for the API key 19 (CreateTopics).
  - The MaxVersion for the CreateTopics API is at least 7.

  Notes

  - You don't have to implement support for the CreateTopics request in this stage. We'll get to this in later
  stages.
  - You'll still need to include the entry for APIVersions in your response to pass the previous stage.

  Stage 2: CreateTopics with Invalid Topic Names

  In this stage, you'll add support for handling CreateTopics requests with invalid topic names and return
  proper error responses.

  Handling Invalid Topic Names

  Your Kafka implementation should validate topic names and return appropriate error codes when a client tries
  to create topics with invalid names. Topic names must follow these rules:
  - Cannot be empty string
  - Cannot be "." or ".."
  - Maximum length of 249 characters
  - Only ASCII alphanumerics, '.', '_', and '-' are allowed
  - Cannot have period/underscore collision patterns

  Tests

  The tester will execute your program like this:

  ./your_program.sh

  It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send a CreateTopics (v7) request with an invalid topic
  name.

  The tester will validate that:

  - The first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") are valid.
  - The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
  - The error code in the topic result is 17 (INVALID_TOPIC_EXCEPTION).
  - The throttle_time_ms field in the response is 0.
  - The name field in the topic result corresponds to the topic name in the request.
  - The error_message field contains a descriptive error message.

  Notes

  - You'll need to parse the CreateTopics request in this stage to get the topic names.
  - The official docs for the CreateTopics request can be found
  https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html#The_Messages_CreateTopics.
  - Topic name validation logic is in the Kafka source code at
  clients/src/main/java/org/apache/kafka/common/internals/Topic.java.

  Stage 3: CreateTopics with Invalid Partition/Replication Parameters

  In this stage, you'll add support for handling CreateTopics requests with invalid partition counts and
  replication factors.

  Handling Invalid Parameters

  Your Kafka implementation should validate numeric parameters and return appropriate errors:
  - Partition count must be greater than 0 (or -1 for defaults)
  - Replication factor must be greater than 0 (or -1 for defaults)
  - Both parameters cannot be 0 or negative (except -1)

  Tests

  The tester will execute your program like this:

  ./your_program.sh

  It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send CreateTopics (v7) requests with invalid parameters.

  The tester will validate that:

  - The first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") are valid.
  - The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
  - The error code in the topic result is 37 (INVALID_PARTITIONS) for invalid partition count.
  - The error code in the topic result is 38 (INVALID_REPLICATION_FACTOR) for invalid replication factor.
  - The throttle_time_ms field in the response is 0.
  - The name field in the topic result corresponds to the topic name in the request.
  - The error_message field contains a descriptive error message.

  Notes

  - Test cases will include: partition count = 0, partition count = -2, replication factor = 0, replication
  factor = -2.
  - Valid values are positive integers or -1 (for broker defaults).

  Stage 4: CreateTopics with Existing Topics

  In this stage, you'll add support for detecting when a topic already exists and return the appropriate error
  response.

  Handling Existing Topics

  Your Kafka implementation should check if a topic already exists before attempting to create it. You can check
   for existing topics by:
  - Looking for topic directories in the log directory (e.g., /tmp/kraft-combined-logs/topic-name-0/)
  - Reading the __cluster_metadata topic for TopicRecord entries

  Tests

  The tester will execute your program like this:

  ./your_program.sh
  # Create a topic first
  # Then try to create the same topic again

  It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send a CreateTopics (v7) request for an existing topic.

  The tester will validate that:

  - The first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") are valid.
  - The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
  - The error code in the topic result is 36 (TOPIC_ALREADY_EXISTS).
  - The throttle_time_ms field in the response is 0.
  - The name field in the topic result corresponds to the topic name in the request.
  - The error_message field contains a descriptive error message.

  Notes

  - This stage requires basic topic existence checking without full topic creation logic.
  - You can use filesystem checks or metadata parsing to detect existing topics.

  Stage 5: CreateTopics with Invalid Manual Assignment

  In this stage, you'll add support for validating manual partition assignments and return appropriate error
  responses.

  Handling Invalid Manual Assignment

  Your Kafka implementation should validate manual partition assignments when provided:
  - Manual assignment requires partition count and replication factor to be -1
  - Partition indices must be consecutive starting from 0
  - Replica lists cannot be empty
  - Broker IDs must be valid (though you can mock this validation)
  - No duplicate broker IDs within a partition assignment

  Tests

  The tester will execute your program like this:

  ./your_program.sh

  It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send CreateTopics (v7) requests with invalid manual
  assignments.

  The tester will validate that:

  - The first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") are valid.
  - The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
  - The error code in the topic result is 39 (INVALID_REPLICA_ASSIGNMENT).
  - The throttle_time_ms field in the response is 0.
  - The name field in the topic result corresponds to the topic name in the request.
  - The error_message field contains a descriptive error message.

  Notes

  - Test cases include: non-(-1) partition count with assignment, non-consecutive partitions, empty replica
  lists, duplicate broker IDs.
  - Manual assignment validation is complex but can be implemented without broker state.

  Stage 6: CreateTopics with Authorization Failure

  In this stage, you'll add support for authorization checks and return appropriate error responses.

  Handling Authorization

  Your Kafka implementation should check authorization before creating topics:
  - Require CREATE permission on CLUSTER resource or specific TOPIC resource
  - You can implement a simple authorization check based on configuration or mock it
  - Return authorization failure for unauthorized requests

  Tests

  The tester will execute your program like this:

  ./your_program.sh

  It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send CreateTopics (v7) requests without proper
  authorization.

  The tester will validate that:

  - The first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") are valid.
  - The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
  - The error code in the topic result is 29 (TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED).
  - The throttle_time_ms field in the response is 0.
  - The name field in the topic result corresponds to the topic name in the request.
  - The error_message field contains "Authorization failed."

  Notes

  - This stage focuses on authorization error handling rather than implementing full ACL logic.
  - You can use a simple configuration-based approach to determine authorization.

⏺ Here's an improved version of the CreateTopics API breakdown that follows the same progressive structure as
  your Produce API document, with early error cases that can be implemented with just request parsing and
  response encoding before touching any core logic.

⏺ Created the CreateTopics API breakdown document at
  /Users/ryang/Developer/tmp/kafka/kafka/CreateTopics-breakdown.md. The document follows the same progressive
  structure as your Produce API breakdown, with 6 stages that focus on early error cases that can be implemented
   with just request parsing and response encoding before touching any core topic creation logic.

> What is the manual assignment thing ?

⏺ Task(Explain manual assignment in CreateTopics)
  ⎿  Done (25 tool uses · 57.3k tokens · 2m 56.6s)                                                              

⏺ Manual assignment in CreateTopics lets you explicitly specify which brokers should host each partition's
  replicas, instead of letting Kafka automatically place them.

  Manual vs Automatic Assignment

  Automatic (Default):
  - You specify numPartitions: 3 and replicationFactor: 2
  - Kafka automatically distributes partitions across brokers

  Manual:
  - You specify exactly which brokers host each partition
  - Set numPartitions: -1 and replicationFactor: -1
  - Provide an assignments array

  Manual Assignment Structure

  {
    "assignments": [
      {"partitionIndex": 0, "brokerIds": [1, 2]},  // Partition 0 on brokers 1,2
      {"partitionIndex": 1, "brokerIds": [2, 3]},  // Partition 1 on brokers 2,3
      {"partitionIndex": 2, "brokerIds": [3, 1]}   // Partition 2 on brokers 3,1
    ]
  }

  When It's Used

  - Rack awareness: Ensure replicas are on different racks
  - Performance optimization: Place partitions on specific hardware
  - Compliance: Meet data locality requirements
  - Migration: Control placement when moving topics

  Validation Rules

  - Partition indices must be consecutive (0, 1, 2...)
  - All partitions must have same replication factor
  - No duplicate brokers within a partition
  - Brokers must exist in the cluster
  - Can't mix manual assignment with numPartitions/replicationFactor

  The CLI equivalent is:
  kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my-topic --replica-assignment "1:2,2:3,3:1"

  This gives you precise control over partition placement instead of relying on Kafka's automatic distribution
  algorithm.
