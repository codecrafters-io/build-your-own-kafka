In this stage, you'll implement the response body for the `ApiVersions` request.

We've created an interactive protocol inspector for the `ApiVersions` request & response: 

- ðŸ”Ž [ApiVersions Request (v4)](https://binspec.org/kafka-api-versions-request-v4)
- ðŸ”Ž [ApiVersions Response (v4)](https://binspec.org/kafka-api-versions-Response-v4)


### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
$ ./your_program.sh
```

It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send a valid `ApiVersions` (v4) request.

The tester will validate that:

- The first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") are valid.
- The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
- The error code in the response body is `0` (No Error).
- The response body contains at least one entry for the API key `18` (ApiVersions).
- For `ApiVersions`, `MinVersion` is `0` and `MaxVersion` is `4`.

### Notes

- The tester will always send you v4 of the ApiVersions request.
- From this stage onwards, the tester will start validating the first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") in addition to the other checks.
- If extra bytes are remaining after decoding all the fields of the response body, this will be considered an error.
