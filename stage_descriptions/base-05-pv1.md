In this stage, you'll implement the response body for the `ApiVersions` request.

### The `ApiVersions` API (Recap)

As a recap, the [`ApiVersions`](https://kafka.apache.org/protocol.html#The_Messages_ApiVersions) API returns the broker's supported API versions. The response includes a list of APIs, along with their minimum and maximum supported versions.

We've created an interactive protocol inspector to help you visualize the request and response structures:

- ðŸ”Ž [ApiVersions Request (v4)](https://binspec.org/kafka-api-versions-request-v4)
- ðŸ”Ž [ApiVersions Response (v4)](https://binspec.org/kafka-api-versions-Response-v4)


### The `ApiVersions` Response Body

The `ApiVersions` response body (v4) has the following structure:

| Field              | Data type      | Description                                    |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `error_code`       | `INT16`        | Error code (`0` for successful requests)         |
| `api_keys`         | `COMPACT_ARRAY`| Array of supported APIs with version ranges    |
| `throttle_time_ms` | `INT32`        | Throttle time in milliseconds                  |
| `TAG_BUFFER`       | `TAGGED_FIELDS`| Optional tagged fields                         |

Each entry in the `api_keys` array contains:

| Field          | Data type       | Description                    |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `api_key`      | `INT16`         | The API identifier             |
| `min_version`  | `INT16`         | Minimum supported version      |
| `max_version`  | `INT16`         | Maximum supported version      |
| `TAG_BUFFER`   | `TAGGED_FIELDS` | Optional tagged fields                  |

For this stage, your response must include at least one entry for API key `18` (ApiVersions) with a `min_version` of `0` and `max_version` of `4`.

Here's an example of what your response might look like:

```java
00 00 00 13  // message_size:      19 bytes
ab cd ef 12  // correlation_id:    (matches request)
00 00        // error_code:        0 (no error)
02           // api_keys array length:    1 element
00 12        // api_key:           18 (ApiVersions)
00 00        // min_version:       0
00 04        // max_version:       4
00           // TAG_BUFFER:        empty
00 00 00 00  // throttle_time_ms:  0
00           // TAG_BUFFER:        empty
```

This is the first stage where the tester will validate the `message_size` field. For example, if your response header is 4 bytes and your body is 15 bytes, your `message_size` should be `19`.

### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
$ ./your_program.sh
```

It will then connect to your server on port `9092` and send a valid `ApiVersions` (v4) request:

```
$ echo -n "0000001a0012000467890abc00096b61666b612d636c69000a6b61666b612d636c6904302e3100" | xxd -r -p | nc localhost 9092 | hexdump -C
```

Here's what the request looks like:

```java
00 00 00 1a  // message_size:        26
00 12        // request_api_key:     18 (ApiVersions)
00 04        // request_api_version: 4
67 89 0a bc  // correlation_id:      1736982204
...          // rest of header and body
```

The tester will validate your response by checking that:

- The `message_size` field correctly represents the size of the header and body.
- The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
- The `error_code` in the response body `0`.
- The response includes an entry for API key `18` (ApiVersions), where the `min_version` is `0` and the `max_version` is `4`.
- No extra bytes remain after decoding all response fields.

### Notes

- The tester will always send you v4 of the `ApiVersions` request.
- From this stage onwards, the tester will start validating the first 4 bytes of your response (the `message_size`) in addition to the other checks.
