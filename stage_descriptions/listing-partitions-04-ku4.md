In this stage, you'll implement the `DescribeTopicPartitions` response for a single topic with multiple partitions.

ðŸš§ **We're still working on instructions for this stage**. You can find notes on how the tester works below.

In the meantime, please use

to ask questions on the forum.

### Tests

The tester will execute your program like this:

```bash
$ ./your_program.sh /tmp/server.properties
```

It'll then connect to your server on port 9092 and send a `DescribeTopicPartitions` (v0) request. The request will contain an single topic name. The topic exists and has 2 partitions assigned to it.

The tester will validate that:

- The first 4 bytes of your response (the "message length") are valid.
- The correlation ID in the response header matches the correlation ID in the request header.
- The error code in the response body is `0` (NO_ERROR).
- The response body should be valid DescribeTopicPartitionResponse.
- The `topic_name` field in the response should be equal to the topic name sent in the request.
- The `topic_id` field in the response should be equal to the topic UUID of the topic.
- The partition response should contain details of the 2 partitions assigned to the topic.
- There should be 2 partition responses.
- The error code in both the partition responses should be `0` (NO_ERROR).
- The `partition_index` field in both the partition responses should be equal to the partition ID of the partition assigned to the topic.
- The value of `cursor` is -1, indicating that the cursor is null.
