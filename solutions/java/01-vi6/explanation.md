The entry point for your Kafka implementation is in `src/main/java/Main.java`.

Study and uncomment the relevant code: 

```java
// Uncomment this block to pass the first stage

ServerSocket serverSocket = null;
Socket clientSocket = null;
int port = 9092;
try {
  serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
  // Since the tester restarts your program quite often, setting SO_REUSEADDR
  // ensures that we don't run into 'Address already in use' errors
  serverSocket.setReuseAddress(true);
  // Wait for connection from client.
  clientSocket = serverSocket.accept();
} catch (IOException e) {
  System.out.println("IOException: " + e.getMessage());
} finally {
  try {
    if (clientSocket != null) {
      clientSocket.close();
    }
  } catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("IOException: " + e.getMessage());
  }
}
```
